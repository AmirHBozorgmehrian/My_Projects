# My_Projects/LittleLemon

  I created this code as final project for Django Web Framework course presented by Meta in Coursera.


  In order to use the website you must first open a terminal and write "python manage.py runserver". if this executes succcessfully you will see "http://127.0.0.1:8000/" underlined in your terminal.
Copy that link and paste it in your web browser (any web browser should work) then, LittleLemon wedsite should open.
In the website you can check the menu, see price and describtion for each item and you can also make a reservation (please note that this website is not connected to any actual restaurant).
